"""
Database Connection Management
Provides connection retry logic and health monitoring

⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT IMPORT THIS MODULE IN FLASK APP
This module contains raw SQLAlchemy engine management that conflicts with Flask-SQLAlchemy.

Flask-SQLAlchemy automatically manages engines and connections.
Mixing both causes "connection is closed" errors in Passenger workers.

✅ CORRECT: Use only Flask-SQLAlchemy
❌ WRONG: Import create_engine_with_retry or use manual engines

This file is kept for reference only - not used in the Flask application.
